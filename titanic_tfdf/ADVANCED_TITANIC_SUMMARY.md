- **Smart visualization** of feature distributions and relationships  
- **Correlation analysis** with target variable insights
- **Missing value heatmaps** and statistical summaries

### 2. Advanced Feature Engineering (`src/features.py`)
- **Social title extraction** with intelligent grouping (Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master, Nobility, Professional, Rare)
- **Cabin deck analysis** with luxury-level grouping (Upper, Middle, Lower decks)
- **Sophisticated ticket analysis** including prefix categorization
- **Family dynamics**: FamilySize, IsAlone, HasSiblings, HasParents, HasChildren
- **Age binning** with life-stage categories (Child, Teen, Young Adult, etc.)
- **Interaction features**: Sex_Pclass, Title_Pclass, AgeGroup_Pclass
- **Target encoding**: Survival rates by Title, Deck, Sex-Class combinations
- **Train+test concatenation** for global feature engineering context

### 3. Intelligent Imputation
- **Group-based age imputation** using Title + Pclass medians
- **Fare imputation** by Pclass + Embarked groups
- **Robust fallback strategies** for edge cases

### 4. CatBoost Modeling with Production Techniques (`src/catboost_model.py`)

- **Stratified cross-validation** for robust evaluation
- **Hyperparameter tuning** with RandomizedSearchCV
- **Ensemble modeling** with multiple random seeds
- **Early stopping** and best iteration retraining
- **Feature importance analysis** with automatic plotting
- **SHAP integration** for model interpretability

### 5. Master Pipeline (`src/master_pipeline.py`)
- **End-to-end automation** from raw data to submission
- **Modular design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Error handling** and progress tracking
- **Reproducible results** with proper seed management

## 🏆 Technical Highlights

### Feature Engineering Excellence
- **30+ new features** created from original 11

## 🔬 Technical Implementation Details

### Smart Imputation Strategy
```python
# Age: Title + Pclass groups → Title groups → global median
# Fare: Pclass + Embarked groups → Pclass groups → global median  
# Embarked: Most frequent value
```

### Feature Engineering Pipeline
```python
# 1. Social titles with hierarchy mapping
# 2. Cabin analysis (deck + luxury level)
# 3. Family dynamics (size, alone, relationships)
# 4. Ticket analysis (prefix, type, number)
# 5. Age binning (life stages)
# 6. Interaction features (cross-combinations)
# 7. Target encoding (survival patterns)
```

### Model Configuration
```python
CatBoostClassifier(
    iterations=1000,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    depth=6,
    cat_features=categorical_features,  # Native handling
    early_stopping_rounds=50,
    eval_metric='Accuracy'
)
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
cd titanic_tfdf
python -m src.master_pipeline quick
```

### Full Pipeline (with EDA)
```bash
python -m src.master_pipeline
```

### Custom Modeling
```python
from src.features import engineer_advanced_features
from src.catboost_model import AdvancedTitanicModel

# Engineer features
train_eng, test_eng = engineer_advanced_features(train_df, test_df)

# Train model
model = AdvancedTitanicModel()
predictions, results = model.run_advanced_modeling_pipeline(train_eng, test_eng)
```

## 🏅 Why This Approach Wins

1. **Data-Driven**: Every feature is backed by domain knowledge and statistical analysis
2. **Robust**: Ensemble methods and proper validation prevent overfitting  
3. **Interpretable**: SHAP analysis reveals which features drive predictions
