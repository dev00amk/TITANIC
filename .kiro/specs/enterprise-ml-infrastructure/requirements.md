# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms an existing Kaggle Titanic TF-Decision-Forests pipeline into a production-quality, enterprise-grade ML infrastructure repository. The system will reproduce the current best-performing model while wrapping it in industrial-grade tooling including reproducible environments, automated testing, data contracts, experiment tracking, CI/CD pipelines, and security scanning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want a reproducible development environment, so that all team members can work with identical dependencies and avoid "works on my machine" issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is cloned THEN the system SHALL provide uv-based dependency management with locked versions
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL create an isolated virtual environment with pinned package versions
3. WHEN the environment is recreated THEN the system SHALL produce identical package versions across different machines
4. WHEN new dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL automatically update the lockfile

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want automated code quality enforcement, so that the codebase maintains consistent style and catches issues before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run pre-commit hooks with ruff, black, isort, mypy, and nbstripout
2. WHEN code fails quality checks THEN the system SHALL prevent the commit and provide clear error messages
3. WHEN notebooks are committed THEN the system SHALL strip output cells automatically
4. WHEN type annotations are missing THEN the system SHALL flag the code during mypy checks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can confidently refactor and extend the codebase without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL execute unit tests with pytest
2. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL use hypothesis for property-based testing
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL test the complete pipeline end-to-end
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear failure messages and stack traces

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want data contracts and quality checks, so that I can detect data drift and schema violations early in the pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is ingested THEN the system SHALL validate against Pandera schemas
2. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed validation reports
3. WHEN schema violations occur THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages
4. WHEN data passes validation THEN the system SHALL log successful validation metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want centralized configuration management, so that I can easily adjust model parameters and pipeline settings without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configurations are needed THEN the system SHALL use Hydra for hierarchical config management
2. WHEN parameters change THEN the system SHALL support config overrides via command line
3. WHEN multiple environments exist THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configs
4. WHEN configs are invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want experiment tracking and model registry, so that I can compare model performance and manage model versions systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN experiments run THEN the system SHALL log metrics, parameters, and artifacts to MLflow
2. WHEN models are trained THEN the system SHALL register models with version tracking
3. WHEN comparing experiments THEN the system SHALL provide a web UI for visualization
4. WHEN models are deployed THEN the system SHALL track model lineage and metadata

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want data versioning, so that I can track dataset changes and ensure reproducible model training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN datasets change THEN the system SHALL version data using DVC
2. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL pull the correct version automatically
3. WHEN data pipelines run THEN the system SHALL track data lineage and dependencies
4. WHEN collaborating THEN the system SHALL sync data versions across team members

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want automated build and deployment, so that I can focus on model development rather than infrastructure management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN the system SHALL run CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions
2. WHEN builds succeed THEN the system SHALL create and push Docker images
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL cache dependencies for faster subsequent runs
4. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL follow proper promotion workflows

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want automated security scanning, so that I can identify vulnerabilities and compliance issues early in the development cycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN builds run THEN the system SHALL generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using syft
2. WHEN vulnerabilities exist THEN the system SHALL scan for CVEs using grype
3. WHEN secrets are committed THEN the system SHALL detect them using gitleaks
4. WHEN security issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide detailed remediation guidance

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want structured model promotion and documentation, so that models can be safely deployed to production with proper governance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are ready for production THEN the system SHALL provide a promotion checklist
2. WHEN models are deployed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive model cards
3. WHEN documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL auto-generate API documentation
4. WHEN compliance is required THEN the system SHALL track model approval workflows

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want feature store integration readiness, so that I can easily migrate to a feature store architecture when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feature definitions exist THEN the system SHALL provide Feast-compatible feature view stubs
2. WHEN features are accessed THEN the system SHALL support both batch and online serving patterns
3. WHEN feature store migration occurs THEN the system SHALL minimize code changes required
4. WHEN feature lineage is needed THEN the system SHALL track feature dependencies and transformations

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a ML engineer, I want to reproduce the original Kaggle TF-DF model performance, so that the enterprise infrastructure doesn't compromise model quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL reproduce the original TF-DF Gradient Boosted Trees model
2. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL output a valid submission.csv file
3. WHEN model performance is measured THEN the system SHALL achieve equivalent or better accuracy than the original
4. WHEN the model trains THEN the system SHALL use the same preprocessing and feature engineering logic
